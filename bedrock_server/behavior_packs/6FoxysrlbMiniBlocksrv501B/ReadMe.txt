SPECIAL THANKS
==============
Thanks to Wizarduss for creating the pack files.
Thanks to VisionedPlot192 for 8Bit texture files

Version 4.0: FIXED FOR 1.16.100
===============================

Fixed Drispenser / Dropper Trades (See Known Issues Below)
Added Stained Glass
Added Coloured Wool


Known Issues for 1.16.100 
1. TP Issues
Moving Mini Blocks is glitchy due to how teleporting entities is handled in 1.16.100
If the mini block doesn't move when adjusted, re-log to see it has moved properly.

2. Dispensers and Droppers
Crafted dispensers and droppers have a default data value of 3, whereas given (using commands) items have the correct data value of 0.
This means the wandering traders trades have had to be changed to require dispensers and droppers that have the directional component in order to work. This may cause problems on later versions.
Affects: 
- Dispenser
- Dropper
